## 🌟 About ChittaStack

**ChittaStack** is an open-source collective building cognitive memory infrastructure for intelligent agents, autonomous systems, and adaptive LLM-based workflows. Inspired by the Sanskrit term "Chitta" (चित्त), meaning the memory-impression layer of the mind, ChittaStack aims to bring memory that evolves, reflects, and adapts.

### 🔍 Mission

To build a robust, modular, and framework-agnostic memory engine that empowers agents to reason, recall, and evolve over time — just like a mind.

### 🚀 Core Product

-   **MemoryService** – a plug-and-play, layered memory engine with support for:
    
    -   Raw logs, summaries, vector embeddings, and graph relationships
        
    -   Intent-based and goal-oriented memory recall
        
    -   Memory scoring, fading, and timeline-based access
        
    -   Zero-dependency offline mode

## 🔌 Compatible Ecosystems

-   LangChain
    
-   CrewAI
    
-   AutoGen
    
-   ADK (LlamaIndex)
    
-   Vanilla LLM applications
    
-   Edge agents, CLI agents, and browser workers

## 🧠 What We Believe

-   Memory is not just storage — it is cognition.
    
-   Agents should evolve their memory like humans: forget, highlight, and learn.
    
-   Developers deserve open, transparent, and modular tools.
